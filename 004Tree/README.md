# Binary Tree

## Definition

(Available From [Wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree))
A **binary tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has **at most two children**, which are referred to as *the left child* and the *right child*. A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a triple **(L, S, R)**, where **L** and **R** are binary trees or the empty set and **S** is a singleton set.

## Features & Characteristics

- A rooted binary tree has a root node and every node has at most two children.
- A **full binary tree** is a tree in which every node in the tree has either 0 or 2 children.
- A **perfect binary tree** is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level. (This is ambiguously also called a complete binary tree).
- A **balanced binary tree** has the minimum possible maximum height (a.k.a. depth) for the leaf nodes, because for any given number of leaf nodes, the leaf nodes are placed at the greatest height possible.
