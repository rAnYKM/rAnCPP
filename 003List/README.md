# Linear List - Array List & Linked List

## Storage of Linear List

**Dynamic Array List**	- Allocate a valid block of memory with space for *n* (the number of elements in the list) elements of the type.
```c++
	int *list = new int[5] 
```
*E.g. the statement above allocates a block of memory with 5 int variables for list*

**Single Linked List**	- Each element has its own space, and they are not necessarily contiguous in the memory allocation. Besides, to maintain the *next* pointer, each element occupies more space than the size of their type.

## Implementation of Linear List

Refer to this link: [CMU Slides - Stack & Queue](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/Stacks%20and%20Queues.html)

### Stack

A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.

### Queue

A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.
